Goal	                                  Tool/Command
View resolved POM	                      mvn help:effective-pom
This combines your pom.xml and all of the parents poms in a long consolidated pom

Trace version source (BOM, parent)	    mvn dependency:tree -Dverbose
We can see which transitive dependencies are pulled, with the -Dverbose we can see 
if it's managed by a BOM or via DependencyManagement, if it is overridden by conflicts, 
and also if it is excluded, optional, or transitive

See settings.xml sources                mvn help:effective-settings
This doesn’t help with dependency versions, but it helps you see mirror repositories, activeProfiles, etc., which may affect resolution.

See property sources	                  mvn help:all-profiles
This will show inherited profiles and properties — helpful to see which POMs contributed properties, especially if coming from parent POMs or BOMs.

Find dependency updates	                mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
Which versions are locked
Which are overridden or can be updated
Where they’re coming from (direct vs managed)
