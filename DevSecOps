# DevSecOps Program

## 1. Introduction
- What is DevSecOps?
- Why it matters (business value, risk reduction, faster delivery).
- Our organization’s vision for DevSecOps.

---

## 2. DevSecOps Fundamentals
- Principles (Shift-left, automation, “security as code,” shared responsibility).
- Differences between DevOps and DevSecOps.
- Core frameworks (OWASP SAMM, DSOMM, NIST guidance).

---

## 3. DevSecOps Lifecycle
*(8 DevOps phases with security built in)*  
- **Plan** – threat modeling, secure requirements.  
- **Code** – secure coding guidelines, pre-commit hooks.  
- **Build** – SCA, secrets scanning.  
- **Test** – SAST, DAST, unit & integration tests with security gates.  
- **Release** – artifact signing, approval workflows.  
- **Deploy** – IaC scanning, runtime hardening.  
- **Operate** – monitoring, incident response.  
- **Monitor** – SIEM, security dashboards, feedback loop.  

---

## 4. CI/CD Integration
- Our CI/CD platforms (e.g., GitLab, Jenkins, Harness).
- Where security checks fit in pipelines (SCA in Build, DAST in Test, policy gates in Deploy).
- Example pipeline diagram with security gates.

---

## 5. Security Tooling
- **SAST (Static Analysis)** – what, why, where it runs.  
- **DAST (Dynamic Analysis)** – runtime testing before release.  
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)** – open-source dependency checks.  
- **Secrets Detection** – preventing credential leaks.  
- **Container/Cloud Scanning** – runtime and infrastructure checks.  
- Mapping of tools we use today (SonarQube, Anchore, etc.).  

---

## 6. Governance & Policy
- Quality gates (fail on critical/high issues with fixes available).
- Risk acceptance & exceptions.
- Vulnerability SLAs (e.g., critical = fix in 7 days).
- Integration with ticketing (e.g., Jira automation).

---

## 7. Metrics & Reporting
- Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR).
- Vulnerability age tracking.
- Coverage of tests (SAST, DAST, SCA).
- Deployment frequency & lead time (from DORA metrics).

---

## 8. Roles & Responsibilities
- RACI chart for Security, Dev, Ops.
- How teams collaborate in pipelines.
- Security Champions program.

---

## 9. Roadmap & Maturity Model
- Where we are today (Current State).
- Target state (Next 12–24 months).
- Alignment with industry maturity models (e.g., OWASP DSOMM).

---

## 10. Resources
- Internal guidelines & playbooks.
- Links to tools, dashboards, policies.
- External resources (OWASP, DevSecBlueprint, NIST).
